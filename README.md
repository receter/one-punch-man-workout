[Why I did this project](https://dev.to/receter/one-punch-man-workout-app-source-code-3dcp)

## Todos

- A calendar at the bottom where you can see check marks for each completed day.
- Setting screen with some checkboxes where you can set which of the exercises to track (for example, if you want to opt out of the 10km running).

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
